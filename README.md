## The Beginning 
Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub repository documenting my journey of learning and exploring Linux as a beginner. As someone new to the world of Linux, I've created this repository to share my experiences, insights, and resources I've found useful along the way. Whether you're also just starting out or you're a seasoned Linux user looking to reminisce about your own beginnings, I hope you find something valuable here. Feel free to explore, leave feedback, or even join me in this exciting learning adventure!


## The Why

I've chosen to dive into learning Linux as a beginner for my journey into IT for several reasons. Firstly, Linux is the backbone of much of the IT infrastructure worldwide. Whether it's servers, networking equipment, or even mobile devices, Linux is everywhere. Understanding Linux gives me a solid foundation to work with a wide range of systems and environments.

Moreover, Linux is known for its stability, security, and scalability. These are critical aspects of IT that I want to master early on in my career. By learning Linux, I'm equipping myself with the skills needed to maintain robust and secure systems, which is invaluable in today's tech landscape.

Another reason for choosing Linux is its open-source nature. The vast community behind Linux means there's a wealth of resources available for learning and troubleshooting. Plus, being part of the open-source community allows me to contribute to projects, collaborate with others, and continuously improve my skills.



## Linux Distribution of choice
So I've decided to dive into **Rocky Linux 9** for my Linux learning journey, and here's why.

- First and foremost, Rocky Linux is a community-driven, enterprise-grade Linux distribution designed to be a seamless replacement for CentOS. It's built to be rock-solid (pun intended) and stable, which is exactly what I need as I dive into learning Linux. Having that stability means I can focus on learning without worrying about frequent changes or instability.

- Another big reason for choosing Rocky Linux is its strong ties to the open-source community and its close relationship with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Since it's a downstream rebuild of RHEL, I'll essentially be working with a free, community-supported version of RHEL. This is incredibly valuable because RHEL is widely used in enterprise environments, so learning on Rocky Linux means I'll be gaining skills that are directly transferable to real-world scenarios and job opportunities.
